const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url); //new line
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename); //new line

const app = express();
const PORT = 5007;

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "build"))); //new line

app.get("/samid", (req, res) => {
    try {
      res.status(200).json({ message: "I samid" });
    } catch (error) {
      res.status(500).json({ message: error.response.data });
    }
  });
  

//new line
app.get("/*", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "build", "index.html"));
